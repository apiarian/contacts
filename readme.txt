A small program which polls the OS X Address Book for information about
contacts.

The only currently supported search criteria are First and/or Last
Names.

The program output is limited to the First Name, Last Name, and
birthday.  These may be formatted using the -f option.  Additional
output types easy to implment, but my original goal for this program was
simply to get the birtday of the contact.
